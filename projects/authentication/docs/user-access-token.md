# User access token

## Overview

User access tokens are used to communicate with a publiq API in the name of a user logged in through UiTID, and can be requested through one of two ways depending on the type of application that you're building.

Both flows are standard [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) flows and work largely the same. In both cases you will redirect the user to the authorization server where they can login. Afterward, the user will be redirected back to your application and you will receive an authorization code. With this code you can request a user access token on the authorization server.

> At the end of this page you can find more info about specific configuration that you will need on publiq's authorization servers, like their domain names.

### Regular web applications

Regular web applications **(with a backend)** should use the **Authorization Code Flow** with their client id and secret. The secret must be stored and used on the backend in all circumstances, never on the frontend.

To learn more about the Authorization Code Flow, see the [the Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/authorization-code-flow).

### Single-page (SPA) and native applications

Native (mobile & desktop) and frontend applications **without a backend** (single-page applications) do not have a way to securely store their client secret.

Native binaries can be decompiled to reveal their secret, and Javascript applications running in the browser are running in an inherently unsafe environment to store secrets.

These applications must use the **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE** (*Proof Key for Code Exchange*).

The main difference with the regular Authorization Code Flow is that with PKCE, your app can utilize a dynamically-generated secret to initiate and validate the flow instead of a fixed client secret which must never be made public.

To learn more about the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE, see the [the Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/authorization-code-flow-with-proof-key-for-code-exchange-pkce).

> If you want, you can use the [Single-Page Application (SPA) SDK Libraries](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries#spa) provided by Auth0 to implement this flow in frontend Javascript applications. Native applications can use the [Native and Mobile Application SDK Libraries](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries#native).

## Client configuration

Before you can use one of the Authorization Code flows above, your client needs the following configuration **on the authorization server**:

*   **Login URI**: The absolute URI of the page where your users will login. For example `https://example.com/login`.
*   **Callback URL(s)**: The absolute URL(s) of the page(s) where your users can be redirected back to after they log in. You can specify this callback URL whenever you redirect a user to the authorization server to log in, but it needs to be **whitelisted** first to prevent phishing attacks. For example `https://example.com/authorize`.
*   **Logout URL(s)**: The absolute URL(s) of the page(s) where your users can be redirected back to *after* they log out. This page should also clear any tokens or other session data that you store for the user in your app. You can specify this URL whenever you redirect a user to the authorization server to log out, but it needs to be **whitelisted** first to prevent phishing attacks. For example `https://example.com/logout`.

Additionally, if you want to use the PKCE flow you will also need to specify:

*   **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: The domain name(s) of the application(s) that you will be using the PKCE flow on. For example `example.com`.

> A way to configure your client's settings on the authorization server will be provided in the future.
>
> In the meantime you can contact vragen@uitdatabank.be to make sure your client has the correct URI configuration on the authorization server or make changes.

## Domains

The authorization server is available on two domains, one for production and one for testing.

*   Production: https://account.uitid.be
*   Testing: https://account-test.uitid.be

You will need to use the domain of the same environment as the environment of the API you're integrating with.

For example: To communicate with the test environment of UiTdatabank of UiTPAS, you will need a token from the test environment of the authorization server.

Your client id and secret will also vary per environment.

## Audience

Both authorization flows require an `audience` parameter when redirecting the user to the authorization server to log in. In both scenarios the audience must be set to  `https://api.publiq.be`.

## Expiration

After you have received your user access token through one of the two OAuth flows described above, there are two ways to check when your token expires:

1.  Cache the `expires_in` property included in the token response, and the time that you requested the token. Using these two parameters, you can calculate the expiration time of the token and request a new one when it is expired. Note that if you follow this approach, you should account for clock skew between your server and the APIs' servers, so it's best to already request a new token a couple of minutes before the cached one will expire.
2.  Keep using the same cached token until you get a `401` response from an API endpoint, at which point you can request a new token and perform the failed request again with the new token.

## Token parsing

<!-- theme: warning -->

> **Never** parse a user access token as a JWT, for example to check its expiration time. It is not guaranteed that a user access token will always be a JWT. The claims inside the token can also change, so you should not rely on them.
