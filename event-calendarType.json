  "description": "Determines how often the [event](./models/event.json) occurs.\n\nPossible values: `single`, `multiple`, `periodic`, `permanent`.\n\n- **single**: For events that take place at one single day (e.g. a concert of Radiohead) and events with only one start and end date (e.g. camping from monday until sunday). **Must** have 1 [subEvent](./models/event-subEvent.json). Will automatically get a [startDate](./models/event-startDate.json) and [endDate](./models/event-endDate.json) based on the `subEvent`.\n\n- **multiple**: For events that take place on several occasions, whether or not contiguous (e.g. a festival). **Must** have 2+ [subEvents](./models/event-subEvent.json). Will automatically get a [startDate](./models/event-startDate.json) and [endDate](./models/event-endDate.json) based on the `subEvents`.\n\n- **periodic**: For events that take places on recurring moments (e.g. a course watercolor painting, each wednesday evening). **Must** have a [startDate](./models/event-startDate.json) and [endDate](./models/event-endDate.json). Can optionally have [openingHours](./models/event-openingHours.json).\n\n- **permanent**: Not recommended for events, consider creating a [place](./models/place.json) instead. Can optionally have [openingHours](./models/event-openingHours.json). [Here is a detailed guide](./entry-api/shared/calendar-info#calendartype) with more information.",
